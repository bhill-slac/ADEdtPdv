#  Name: README
#
#  Rem:	This is a driver for the EDT frame grabber with support
#		for various cameras compatible with the camera-link interface.
#
#==============================================================
#
EPICS Verions:
--------------
This driver has currently been built and tested at SLAC with EPICS 3.14.12

Operating System:
-------------------
This driver has been tested for linux-x86_64 on RHEL-5
and for linuxRT_glibc_x86_64

Driver Installation:
-------------------
The driver files drom EDT are installed in /opt/EDTpdv.
To install, run as root:
	/opt/EDTpdv/pcds_edtinit start

This can be added to /reg/d/iocCommon/<your_ioc_host>/startup.cmd
to run when the linux system is started.
This is necessary for diskless nodes, as the EDT driver is not installed
by the boot image.

RCX Modules:
------------------
At SLAC, we commonly deploy EDT cameras using RCX C-Link converters
which are used to send the camlink signals over fiber and back to
camlink on the other end.   The RCX boxes come pre-programmed with
a blink code, and the blink codes need to match your camera and setup.

If needed, you can change the blink codes.
See https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PCDS/Controls+Cameras
to find the RCX manual for how to set the blink codes.
NOTE: If you change a blink code, mark the RCX to show the new code!!!

RCX Blink Codes:
Camera-Model	Camera-End		Framegrabber-End
UNIQ UP900-CL		1-2				2-2
UNIQ UP685-CL		1-2				2-2
Pulnix 6740			1-2				2-2
Opal 1000			1-4				2-4

Note: Up until Oct 2011, we've been using 1-1/2-1 for the UNIQ
cameras, but we recently found that the UP685 needs code 2-2 on
the framegrabber end when using a PCIe8 DV-CL framegrabber.
As this code also works for our other EDT framegrabbers and UNIQ
cameras, I've changed my recommendation from 1-1/2-1 to 1-2/2-2.

How to use this module in your IOC
------------------
1.	Add the following lines in your iocTop/configure/RELEASE:
ADEDTPDV_MODULE_VERSION=R0.4.0   (use current version here)
ADEDTPDV=$(EPICS_MODULES)/ADEdtPdv/$(ADEDTPDV_MODULE_VERSION)

2.  

3.	Add the following lines in your <appName>/Db/Makefile:
 DB += ?.db

4.	Add the following lines in your <appName>/src/Makefile:
<appName>_DBD += commonDriverSupport.dbd
<appName>_DBD += edtPdvSupport.dbd
<appName>_DBD += stream.dbd
<appName>_LIBS += ADBase
<appName>_LIBS += stream
<appName>_LIBS += edtPdv
<appName>_LIBS += pdv

Add the following lines in your iocBoot/ioc<iocName>/st.cmd,
# TODO - fill in here

5. General notes
	The camera won't take pictures without a trigger signal connected to
	the lemo input to the camera.

	Without a lens, your images will likely be all white or all black
	depending on how much light reaches the camera.

	The camera images can be large.  This can cause failures to read
	images across gateways or via edm if EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY is too small!

	The videowidget TwoDProfileMonitor may need to be added to edm so you can display images.

	When you configure the TwoDProfileMonitor widget, the Data Width must match
	the number of columns in your images.  Widget width and height can vary, but
	you'll get the best images if they are scaled down by 1/2, 1/4, etc.

	If you want to reduce the amount of data in the images and you don't need
	the entire image, you can define a region of interest and clip the image
	to that region.
